# code-quiz 

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a quiz website that would provide the user with an array of coding-related questions. The user is prompted to make correct choices based on their knowledge of coding. The answers (both correct and incorrect) are logged into local storage. Points are awarded or detracted based on right or wrong answers. Additionally, if the user is to guess incorrectly, time is taken away from the countdown timer. The game ends when the user answers all of the questions OR when the timer runs out. When the game ends, the user is able to log his/her high score and view the log of all high scores. In order to accomplish all this, I created functions, arrays, for loops, if/else statements, and many variables in Javascript. I learned a lot about how functions and variables relate to each other and just how much various elements and variables need to relate to one another.
